#TicTacToe with plain vanilla javascript

Tictactoe Game
This game was made entirely by me, not a product of tutorials, off course credit where due to StackOverflow

As of today 13 June the game has two types; Human v Human & Human v Computer. The computer currently dosent have a winning logic, it just plays randomly, so Human will probably wim most times.

I'll like to make HvC have 2 difficulty levels; Easy & Mission-Impossible. 

I'm looking to advance my React JS knowledge so I'll probably pause this project here, but I will definitely make improvements later, especially on that Mission-Impossible level I mentioned, that will be a fun challenge for me :)
